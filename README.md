### Technical Writing 💻
> "An API is only as useful as its documentation" — Me[^2]
[^2]: Elliot K. Goldman on March 18th, 2022

I started technical writing at the beginning of my career with a firm belief that everyone can code. Through teaching, API documentation, product documentation, and general research and technical research, I have experience with a wide myriad of practices.

_A small selection of writing:_
- An article written for CSS Tricks [Comparing the Different Types of Native JavaScript Popups](https://css-tricks.com/comparing-the-different-types-of-native-javascript-popups/)

- Technical and marketing materials for [Sarah Lawrence College](https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/)'s I.T. department ([MYSLC](https://my.slc.edu/ics))

### Programming Background ⚙️

Documentation (or the lack thereof 🙃) is what led me to technical writing.

```swift
// Written in Swift

///This method returns an array of programming languages that I have used at some point in my life
///- Warning: No localization data. Always returns in English.
///- Author: Elliot K. Goldman
///- Parameter void:
///- Returns: A tuple with two values
///    - `numOfYears`: The number of years I've been programming
///    - `languages`: The different languages I've used throughout the years
///- Todo: Learn what's next
///- Note:
/// # Example #
/// ```
/// print(experience.languages.dropLast().joined(separator: ", ")) // C, C++, Java, Javascript, Lua, Objective-C, Python, Swift
///print(experience.numOfYears) //12
/// ```
func programmingExperience() -> (numOfYears: Int, languages: [String]){
    
    let iHaveUsed = [
        "C", //It's been a while
        "C++",
        "Java",
        "Javascript",
        "Lua",
        "Objective-C", //Who still uses Objective-C!?
        "Python",
        "Swift"
    ]
    let numYears = 12 //Number of years programming
    return (numYears, iHaveUsed)
}
let experience = programmingExperience()
print("Elliot has \(experience.numOfYears) years programming experience using at various times: \(experience.languages.dropLast().joined(separator: ", ")), and \(experience.languages.last!) all at various times.")

```
```
Elliot has 12 years programming experience using at various times: C, C++, Java, Javascript, Lua, Objective-C, Python, and Swift.
